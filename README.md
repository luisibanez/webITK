webITK
======

Prototype portal for building ITK plugins as a web service.

This project was initiatited in a conversation with Johannes Schindelin at the
ISBI conference, when exploring a mechanism for making available ITK image
analysis functionalities to applications that are commonly used in the
biomedical imaging, in particular to ImageJ2.

The final target is to have a system in which ITK modules can be build
on-demand and their binaries be pushed back to the application from a remote
build server.

At this point, this project is in its very early Alpha stage.
